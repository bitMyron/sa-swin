    This implementation supports 2D images. For 3D images, please refer to DeepMind's implementation

        class_thresholds: List of class-specific thresholds.
            The thresholds relate to the acceptable amount of deviation in the segmentation boundary in pixels.
            Each threshold needs to be a finite, non-negative number.
        include_background: Whether to skip NSD computation on the first channel of the predicted output.

        get_not_nans: whether to return the `not_nans` count.
            Defaults to ``False``.
            `not_nans` is the number of batch samples for which not all class-specific NSD values were nan values.
            If set to ``True``, the function `aggregate` will return both the aggregated NSD and the `not_nans` count.

    This function computes the (Normalized) Surface Dice (NSD) between the two tensors `y_pred` (referred to as
    :math:`\hat{Y}`) and `y` (referred to as :math:`Y`). This metric determines which fraction of a segmentation
    boundary is correctly predicted. A boundary element is considered correctly predicted if the closest distance to the
    reference boundary is smaller than or equal to the specified threshold related to the acceptable amount of deviation in
    pixels. The NSD is bounded between 0 and 1.

    This implementation supports multi-class tasks with an individual threshold :math:`\tau_c` for each class :math:`c`.
    The class-specific NSD for batch index :math:`b`, :math:`\operatorname {NSD}_{b,c}`, is computed using the function:

    .. math::
        \operatorname {NSD}_{b,c} \left(Y_{b,c}, \hat{Y}_{b,c}\right) = \frac{\left|\mathcal{D}_{Y_{b,c}}^{'}\right| +
        \left| \mathcal{D}_{\hat{Y}_{b,c}}^{'} \right|}{\left|\mathcal{D}_{Y_{b,c}}\right| +
        \left|\mathcal{D}_{\hat{Y}_{b,c}}\right|}
        :label: nsd

    with :math:`\mathcal{D}_{Y_{b,c}}` and :math:`\mathcal{D}_{\hat{Y}_{b,c}}` being two sets of nearest-neighbor
    distances. :math:`\mathcal{D}_{Y_{b,c}}` is computed from the predicted segmentation boundary towards the reference segmentation
    boundary and vice-versa for :math:`\mathcal{D}_{\hat{Y}_{b,c}}`. :math:`\mathcal{D}_{Y_{b,c}}^{'}` and
    :math:`\mathcal{D}_{\hat{Y}_{b,c}}^{'}` refer to the subsets of distances that are smaller or equal to the
    acceptable distance :math:`\tau_c`:

    .. math::
        \mathcal{D}_{Y_{b,c}}^{'} = \{ d \in \mathcal{D}_{Y_{b,c}} \, | \, d \leq \tau_c \}.


    In the case of a class neither being present in the predicted segmentation, nor in the reference segmentation, a nan value
    will be returned for this class. In the case of a class being present in only one of predicted segmentation or
    reference segmentation, the class NSD will be 0.

    This implementation is based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05408 and supports 2D images.
    Be aware that the computation of boundaries is different from DeepMind's implementation
    https://github.com/deepmind/surface-distance. In this implementation, the length of a segmentation boundary is
    interpreted as the number of its edge pixels. In DeepMind's implementation, the length of a segmentation boundary
    depends on the local neighborhood (cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04430).

    Args:
        y_pred: Predicted segmentation, typically segmentation model output.
            It must be a one-hot encoded, batch-first tensor [B,C,H,W].
        y: Reference segmentation.
            It must be a one-hot encoded, batch-first tensor [B,C,H,W].
        class_thresholds: List of class-specific thresholds.
            The thresholds relate to the acceptable amount of deviation in the segmentation boundary in pixels.

            the predicted output. Defaults to ``False``.

            One of [``"euclidean"``, ``"chessboard"``, ``"taxicab"``].
            Defaults to ``"euclidean"``.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `y_pred` and/or `y` are not PyTorch tensors.
        ValueError: If `y_pred` and/or `y` do not have four dimensions.
        ValueError: If `y_pred` and/or `y` have different shapes.

        ValueError: If any class threshold is not finite.
        ValueError: If any class threshold is negative.
