class HausdorffDistanceMetric(CumulativeIterationMetric):
    """
    Compute Hausdorff Distance between two tensors. It can support both multi-classes and multi-labels tasks.
    It supports both directed and non-directed Hausdorff distance calculation. In addition, specify the `percentile`
    parameter can get the percentile of the distance. Input `y_pred` is compared with ground truth `y`.
    `y_preds` is expected to have binarized predictions and `y` should be in one-hot format.
    You can use suitable transforms in ``monai.transforms.post`` first to achieve binarized values.
    `y_preds` and `y` can be a list of channel-first Tensor (CHW[D]) or a batch-first Tensor (BCHW[D]).
    The implementation refers to `DeepMind's implementation <https://github.com/deepmind/surface-distance>`_.

    Example of the typical execution steps of this metric class follows :py:class:`monai.metrics.metric.Cumulative`.

    Args:
        include_background: whether to include distance computation on the first channel of
            the predicted output. Defaults to ``False``.
        distance_metric: : [``"euclidean"``, ``"chessboard"``, ``"taxicab"``]
            the metric used to compute surface distance. Defaults to ``"euclidean"``.
        percentile: an optional float number between 0 and 100. If specified, the corresponding
            percentile of the Hausdorff Distance rather than the maximum result will be achieved.
            Defaults to ``None``.
        directed: whether to calculate directed Hausdorff distance. Defaults to ``False``.
        reduction: define mode of reduction to the metrics, will only apply reduction on `not-nan` values,
            available reduction modes: {``"none"``, ``"mean"``, ``"sum"``, ``"mean_batch"``, ``"sum_batch"``,
            ``"mean_channel"``, ``"sum_channel"``}, default to ``"mean"``. if "none", will not do reduction.
        get_not_nans: whether to return the `not_nans` count, if True, aggregate() returns (metric, not_nans).
            Here `not_nans` count the number of not nans for the metric, thus its shape equals to the shape of the metric.
