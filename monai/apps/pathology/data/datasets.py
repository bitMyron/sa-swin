class PatchWSIDataset(Dataset):
    """
    This dataset reads whole slide images, extracts regions, and creates patches.
    It also reads labels for each patch and provides each patch with its associated class labels.

    Args:
        data: the list of input samples including image, location, and label (see the note below for more details).
        region_size: the size of regions to be extracted from the whole slide image.
        grid_shape: the grid shape on which the patches should be extracted.
        patch_size: the size of patches extracted from the region on the grid.
        transform: transforms to be executed on input data.
        image_reader_name: the name of library to be used for loading whole slide imaging, either CuCIM or OpenSlide.
            Defaults to CuCIM.
        kwargs: additional parameters for ``WSIReader``

    Note:
        The input data has the following form as an example:
        `[{"image": "path/to/image1.tiff", "location": [200, 500], "label": [0,0,0,1]}]`.

        This means from "image1.tiff" extract a region centered at the given location `location`
        with the size of `region_size`, and then extract patches with the size of `patch_size`
        from a grid with the shape of `grid_shape`.
        Be aware the `grid_shape` should construct a grid with the same number of element as `labels`,
        so for this example the `grid_shape` should be (2, 2).
