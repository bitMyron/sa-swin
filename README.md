This repository hosts the code for the MICCAI 2024 paper on a novel deep learning framework that leverages anatomical symmetry for enhanced brain imaging analysis. Our approach integrates a Symmetry-Aware Cross-Attention (SACA) module and Symmetry-Aware Head (SAH) to improve classification and segmentation tasks across MRI and CT modalities.
